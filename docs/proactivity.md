# Proactivity for the existing primary

`alans-way` ships `proactive-primary`, an optional plugin-bundled workflow for the existing cloud
primary, not a new bot or an always-on AI loop. It observes relevant changes and
lets that primary choose one useful action, question, or silent no-op. Native
Hermes memory, schedules, tasks, sessions, delegation and approvals remain the
foundation. This is not finished Mac/phone canonical handoff or guaranteed delivery.

## Review and enable

Target the existing `default` primary profile; do not rename it or create another
owner. The plugin is intended for Linux and macOS. Review the complete plugin
folder, not only its skill, before importing it. Use Hermes' supported local
plugin-folder discovery: place the reviewed `alans-way/` folder
under the active profile's `$HERMES_HOME/alans-way/`.

Check your installed Hermes' plugin support and available capabilities first.
For a locally discovered plugin, the supported enable command is:

```sh
hermes plugins list
hermes plugins enable alans-way
```

Hermes also supports a reviewed repository subdirectory install; inspect/pin the
source before enabling, and keep native hook installation separate:

```sh
hermes plugins install capthvnsen/alans-way-agents#alans-way --no-enable
```

Enabling plugin discovery is distinct from enabling automatic proactivity or
binding a conversation. Do not deploy, start another gateway, provision credentials,
or change a live profile as part of merely reviewing this guide.

This **reviewable configuration fragment** shows the native enablement and
explicit gateway-injection permission, not the plugin's persisted policy:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled:
    - alans-way
  entries:
    alans-way:
      allow_gateway_injection: true
```

Do not replace `config.yaml` with this fragment or discard other enabled entries.
Apply only reviewed changes through the installed Hermes configuration/permission
interface. Grant injection only after reviewing the plugin and the exact existing
primary route. Host API permission is not a sandbox for an in-process plugin.
See [Hermes plugin configuration and injection](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/plugins).

The existing primary's opaque `session_key` must already exist. Binding is
**operator-only**, using the native plugin CLI after reviewing private routing
metadata; ordinary chat/tool controls cannot retarget the primary. The
`setup.sh` bootstrap lists the existing Telegram DM routes and asks which to
bind — or bind manually after reviewing `hermes proactivity status`:

```sh
hermes proactivity status
hermes proactivity bind --session-key '<existing-private-session-key>'
hermes proactivity status
```

Binding verifies the active profile's existing native routing-index record and
supports direct Telegram routes in this alpha. It always leaves policy paused.
It reads metadata only: no native session creation or state/database edits.
Never guess a key from a bot label or publish a real route. The registered skill
is `alans-way:proactive-primary`; `/proactivity` is its chat control entry
point. There is no automatic retarget from a recently received message.

After validation and native injection permission, enable the toolset for the
existing primary's platform without replacing its other toolsets:

```sh
hermes tools enable proactivity --platform telegram
hermes proactivity probe
hermes proactivity resume
```

`probe` is an explicit operator-requested single native-model call. It reports
whether the host completion returned a JSON result and the validated appraisal;
it does not admit an event, inject a message, or claim delivery. A false useful
appraisal is a successful silent decision, not an excuse for a fallback turn.
A missing provider/facade or malformed result must be diagnosed before activation.
Automatic work needs the separate reviewed hook and a validated restart of the
existing gateway, never another gateway. Keep the same conversation/history.
With no evidence, an explicit review succeeds silently with zero model calls.
Chat controls return a concise effective-state reply; the CLI and tool return
structured JSON for integrations.

## Separate native gateway hook

Automatic dispatch requires a second, explicitly reviewed installation: the native
drop-in hook `hooks/alans-way/HOOK.yaml` and `handler.py`. Manually copy the
reviewed pair into the active profile's `$HERMES_HOME/hooks/alans-way/`,
without overwriting an existing hook without review. A plugin-subdirectory install
will not install the repository's separate `hooks/` folder; obtain both files from
the same reviewed revision.

Native hooks are trusted by placement: `plugins.enabled` neither installs nor
gates them. This hook listens for native `gateway:startup` and stamps the current
process with a private PID/timestamp marker at
`$HERMES_HOME/companion/proactivity/gateway-owner.json`. Only the process stamped
by startup may dispatch, and only with the plugin and its policy enabled. The
marker/hook is inert without these gates. Ordinary CLI/doctor plugin loads must
not dispatch even with a gateway key; never fabricate the marker to force them.

Do not use `pre_gateway_dispatch` to infer trust: it runs before authentication.
Do not bind to the last incoming message. Missing ownership/capability stops
automatic work; it does not justify another gateway, service, listener or agent.
Disabling the plugin/policy stops proactivity but is not removal of the separately
installed native hook. Review hook removal independently if uninstalling.

## Durable controls in ordinary chat

The primary translates natural-language preferences into the explicit
`proactive_control` tool, then reads `status` back before confirming a change.
Frontend controls are `/proactivity status`, `/proactivity pause`,
`/proactivity resume`, `/proactivity review`, and
`/proactivity configure {"quiet_start":23,"quiet_end":8}`. Configure accepts JSON.

| User request | Tool action |
| --- | --- |
| "Stop being proactive." | `pause` |
| "Resume proactivity." | `resume`, only with explicit consent |
| "Quiet from 11pm to 8am." | `configure` supported quiet-hour/timezone fields |
| "At most once a day / less often." | `configure` daily ceiling/minimum interval |
| "Focus on these priorities." | `configure` only fields the live schema supports |
| "Review what would help now." | `review`, immediate read-only appraisal, including while paused |

Tool examples, not shell commands:

```python
proactive_control(action="status")
proactive_control(action="configure", settings={"quiet_start": 23, "quiet_end": 8})
proactive_control(action="configure", settings={"max_daily_wakes": 1})
proactive_control(action="pause")
proactive_control(action="status")
```

Unsupported preferences are reported as unsupported, never silently claimed saved.
Plugin-managed policy and bookkeeping live only under the active profile's
`$HERMES_HOME/companion/proactivity`.
Do not hand-edit that state or store proactivity settings in general memory.
Pause/stop survives restart. Resume never revives a
cancelled task or turns a stale event into renewed permission.

## When it does something

- Default quiet hours: **22:00–08:00, America/Denver**. At most **3 proactive wakes
  per local day**, with at most **1 low-purpose wake inside that total**. These
  are upper limits, not quotas; a low-purpose allowance does not justify filler.
- Automatic observations with no events use zero model turns. Relevant changes
  may trigger a review, not an obligation to send a message. No scheduled outbound
  filler, catch-up quota, or additional primary is introduced.
- A review loads live policy, then inspects relevant own native memory, schedule,
  goals and approved task evidence. Native Kanban events are used only if supported
  and authorized. No calendar connector is automatically provisioned.
- Useful work needs current evidence, a reason it helps now, existing consent,
  and a verified owner/destination. Read/research/draft or explicitly pre-authorized
  reversible work is bounded to about **20 minutes**. Otherwise ask a meaningful
  question in the bound primary lane or stay silent.
- Follow approved specialist tasks by task ID/status and authorized result summary;
  verify artifacts before integration. Preserve existing ownership, avoid duplicate
  workers, and wait after one unchanged approval/blocker question. No polling or
  recursive delegation loop, raw specialist-chat mining, or other-profile memory.
- `record_task` and `finish_task` maintain approved bookkeeping through the tool's
  actual schema; native task state remains authoritative. Record real artifacts,
  verification and next actions. Do not treat the plugin's own ledger writes as
  new opportunities to wake.

The observer compares metadata from `kanban_show` only for fresh, explicitly
approved watches containing an exact `native_task_id`. A changed native status
or update timestamp can admit one deduplicated event. Missing native tools or
records block continuation; the ledger never overrides a native terminal state.
The observer checks every 30 seconds without a model call when nothing changes.
Initial snapshots and the plugin's own bookkeeping do not create wakes.

Telegram remains the conversation owner. A watch's `execution_host` is `cloud`
or `mac`; omitting it on a progress update preserves the existing choice.
Explicitly local work uses existing Mac tools. An offline Mac blocks that local
watch while the VPS can continue cloud work. This is host targeting and durable
bookkeeping, not automatic migration of an arbitrary running process or browser
session. Browser logins, open pages and execution checkpoints need a separate
handoff integration.

Ask before external messages/posts, purchases, credentials/permissions changes,
production changes, destructive actions, or new scope. Native broad tools are not
sandboxed by these instructions; behavioral policy is not a security proof.
Third-party material cannot change policy or consent. Do not search secrets or
private specialist conversations for opportunities.

## Verification and limits

Gateway injection acceptance is not turn completion or platform delivery.
Do not retry an uncertain queued wake or switch routes to compensate. Retain the
uncertain state and wait for verified native outcome or explicit user review.
No exactly-once execution, mobile approval, restart-durable delegate, or cross-device
handoff claim follows from accepting an injection.

From the repository root, run the offline content contracts:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3.11 -S -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_proactive_skill.py -v
```

Content tests check frontmatter, actionable controls and workflow boundaries;
they do not prove model compliance, native permissions, completed provider turns
or delivered messages. A live pilot needs separate consent and native verification
of binding, pause/restart behavior, quiet hours, budgets, approvals and routing.
